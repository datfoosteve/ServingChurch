In this world, we face many challenges, temptations, and obstacles. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and defeated. 
But as believers, we have access to the ultimate armor - the armor of God. This armor is not just for physical protection, 
but also for spiritual protection. In this blogpost, we will explore the different pieces of armor that God has provided us with,
 and how we can put them on daily to withstand the attacks of the enemy.

(Ephesians 6:10-18) "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, 
that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, 
but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, 
against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, 
and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints."

We must put on the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel of peace, 
the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and wield the sword of the Spirit - the Word of God. By doing so, 
we can stand firm against the attacks of the enemy and withstand in the evil day.

(Isaiah 59:17) "He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; 
he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak."

Just as a soldier puts on armor to protect themselves in battle, 
we must put on the armor of God to protect ourselves in the spiritual battle. 
Let us armor up and stand firm in the strength of the Lord.
