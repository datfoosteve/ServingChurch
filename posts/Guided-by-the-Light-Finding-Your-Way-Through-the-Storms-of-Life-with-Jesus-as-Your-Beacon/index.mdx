In this world, it can often feel like we are lost at sea, struggling to find our way through the tumultuous waters of life. 
But just as a lighthouse guides ships to safety, so too can Jesus be the beacon that guides us out of darkness and into the light. 
His word is the way, the truth, and the light, providing us with the guidance and direction we need to navigate life's storms and find our way home.

In John 8:12, Jesus says, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." 
Just as a lighthouse provides a ray of hope for sailors lost at sea, so too does Jesus offer us hope and direction in our lives. 
When we follow him, we are never alone, never lost, and never in the dark.

In Matthew 7:7, Jesus says, "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." 
When we are feeling lost and in need of guidance, we need only turn to Jesus and ask for his help. 
He will be there to answer our call and lead us out of darkness and into the light.

In John 14:6, Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." 
When we put our faith in Jesus and follow him, we can be assured that we are on the path to eternal life.
 His word is the truth that will guide us through the storms of life and bring us to safety in the end.

So when you are feeling lost and alone, remember that Jesus is the lighthouse that will guide you out of darkness and into the light. 
His word is the way, the truth, and the light that will provide you with the guidance and direction you need to navigate life's storms and find your way home. 
Follow him and be assured that you are never alone, never lost, and never in the dark.
