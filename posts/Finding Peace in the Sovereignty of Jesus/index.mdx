As believers, it can be easy to become overwhelmed by the worries and anxieties of this world. 
The future can seem uncertain, and the events of our lives can leave us feeling lost and afraid. 
But in these moments, we must remember the truth of who Jesus is and the power he holds over all things.

Jesus is not just our Savior, but he is also the Lord of all creation. 
He is the one who spoke the world into existence, and he holds the power over the seas, the earth, and the air. 
When we truly grasp the magnitude of who Jesus is, it becomes clear that there is nothing in this world that he cannot control.

The Bible reminds us in Matthew 6:25-34, 
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. 
Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, 
and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?"

When we cast our worries and fears onto Jesus, 
we can find peace in the knowledge that he is in control. He has already taken care of us, 
and he will continue to care for us in every moment of our lives. This is not just a comforting thought, 
but it is a truth that we can cling to, no matter what the world may throw our way.

So, my friends, let us trust in the sovereignty of Jesus. Let us lay down our worries and fears at his feet, 
and know that he is the Lord of all creation. In him, we can find peace and hope, no matter what the future may hold.
